# Music-Player-Datbase-Management-System

Music Player is a database application that stores user information, artist information, songs, details of songs, user playlists and can be used to listen to songs saved in the database.
The aim of this project is the development of a sample centralized relational Music store application. This application has to store information of customers and artists with their products. In this context the functionality is to update, remove and insert records for the different entities. The database is built for the users and the artists.
You can save as many songs as you want to. You can categorize them based on artists, time, date added, and your liked songs. You can also create playlists and follow your favorite artists, like your favorite songs or follow playlists made by other users. For artists, they can upload singles or albums. We made sure that no data gets breached and made our application more secure, we store your passwords for faster login and keep your data safe from any risk of being compromised. All of your data is stored so whenever you log in your data is not lost.  
This project team decided to implement the core functionality first and later to attach additional functions. The Core functionality is:
•	Add, delete and update user information.
•	Add, delete, and update information about the album, artists and songs.
•	Users can like their favorite song.
•	Users can create playlists which consist of their favorite songs.
•	Users can follow their favorite artist.
